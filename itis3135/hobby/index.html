    <h2>What is building a computer</h2>
    <p>Building a computer is the process of picking out the parts and then assembling the machine installing all neccessary drivers and other software.
        To me it is a pretty simple process but many find it to be a very daunting task. I find it fun trying to solve the puzzle of being given a budget and trying
        to find the best possible selection of parts that can fit that budget. As I have grown up I have begun to learn more and more about computers
        and started to expand on just tinkering with mine to start helping out others. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many different types of computers that you can build. Thought
        I only build gaming/workstation computers there are also streaming, server 
        and super computers. Building computers is not exclusively an rgb gaming computer
        and when looking at building other types you have to consider different things because 
        something that is useful to a gaming computer may not be as useful to a server system
        or a streaming computer.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Malcolm Chance I am a Junior at UNC Charlotte who is majoring in computer science. I am 20
        years old. My interest in computers came from my uncle who worked on super computers. When I was a kid he had a nice 
        computer that interested me as a kid. After that I became much more interested on computers in general and the creation process
        of a computer 
    </p>
    <p>I got my first computer when I was in 6th grade which was very much a starter computer. It had DDR3 and no graphics card which in todays age would be 
        very almost unheard of. I had this computer till my Freshman year of high school when I got my first real computer which was using DDR4 and had a graphics card. Since 
        I liked the case I've been ungrading this same computer since then. None of the parts that it orginally shipped with are still there but its still the same case.

    <h2>When do I build computers</h2>
    <p>I try to build them whenever I can obvisouly with a hobby like this money is the main factor. I can't afford
        to get the newest parts wheneveer they come out but if a friend or someone I know needs help or wants to build a computer
        I'm always there to help them. I am slowly building up to move my current PC to a new case and try to do a custom loop. This is the pinnacle of PC cooling so I feel like
        it would be something fun to try and do. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I do tend to in general build most of my computers during the holidays when people want computers for christmas and some during 
        the summer for friends. I also am everyones go to person now for any help because I have experienced a lot of problems so I know how to fix a good amount
        or ateast can try to get a prognosis.

    <h2>Where do I build computers</h2>
    <p>At this point with how well parts are built you can build a computer alomost anywhere where you have the room and the peripherals to do so. 
        I know previously when parts where very fragile to where the slightest electrical charge would fry them you would want to take more saefty percautions. Now that 
        you can buy anti static mats you can give youself a safe surface to build on pretty much anywhere without having to worry about frying your parts. 
    </p>
    <p>For me I prefer to build on a large table with all the parts laid out and a table small enough that you can easily get to both sides as it is nice to be able 
        to easily access the back of a case so that you can have good cable mangement. It is very hard to build in a very tight area but it can be done.

<section id="how" class="page">
    <h2>How do you learn to build computers</h2>
    <p>How do you get started building a computer. The first thing you have to do is aquire the parts which doesn't seem difficult but is a hassle. 
        There are so many different brands, types, models of PC hardware that it is very easy to get confused and get something that isn't compatible or isn't going to get 
        you the best performance. Each brand has there own line of hardware each with very similar names all with very slight differences. The main thing I did to learn was to 
        watch YouTube. It's the easiest way to learn and there are a lot of vidoes out there of people building computers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have everything I think the best way to get started is to simply take it slow and truly understand where everything is going. Having built multiple computers now 
        every case is different every cooler is different which makes you have to take a little more time to make sure everything was done correclty.

<section id="why" class="page">
    <h2>Why do I build computers</h2>
    <p>I do it because I enjoy it and it's something that some people are scared to do and will pay you for. I think finding the perfect specs in a price range is fun.
        I also think that the process in general is pretty fun and it's pretty easy. I think as you get into higher end stuff it becomes a rough form of art like when people do 
        custom paint jobs on their pcs or do a very high end and intracite custom loop. I haven't don't anything like that yet but look to doing it in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To forward being paid is that though this is a hobby it could eventually becoeme another form of income if I were to try to make something more of it. Especially
        if I became more confident in custom loops because there a lot of people who will build a computer for you but there aren't that many people that are willing to do a custom loop 
        especially with hard tubing. This is something that I think would be fun to learn and could also be a good way to make some extra money.
