                    <h2>Cowl</h2>
                    <p>This is a cowl which is a type of neckwear. This took about 8 week of total time to make. The yarn used in this is 
                        sheep. A knit like this isn't the most difficult when it comes to stiching but it does take time to make sure that the 
                        sizing and the shape is correct.

                    <h2>Scarf</h2>
                    <p>This image shows a collection of different knitted items. We are going to focus on the scarfs. The two scarfs that are present in this photo 
                        are both lighter longer scarfs that are meant to be worn anytime of the year. The one of the left is an easier knit not containg many designs or
                        extra stiching while the one on the right is a more challenging time consuiming knit with more designs.

                    <h2>In-Progress Sweater</h2>
                    <p>This is a sweater that I am currently knitting. This sweater is in the beginning stages.
                        It is going to be similar to a swater vest as it is going to be sleeveless. Being that it is going to be sleeveless
                        It is going to make it a shorter time to knit overall.
