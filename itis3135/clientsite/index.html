                Welcome to my little corner of the web! My name is Tracey, and by day, Iâ€™m dedicated to caring for patients as a registered nurse. After my shifts at the local hospital, I swap out my scrubs for skeins of yarn and transform into a knitting enthusiast. This website is where I share the joy of my needlework with you, alongside insights from my daily life and experiences in healthcare.

Knitting is not just a hobby for me; it's a form of relaxation and creative expression. Each stitch and pattern represents a moment of peace amid the hustle of hospital life. Over the years, I've knitted everything from cozy scarves and warm mittens to intricate afghans and adorable baby clothes. My projects are infused with the care and dedication I bring to my nursing profession, aiming to spread warmth and comfort to everyone who receives them.

This site serves as a gallery for my creations and a space for sharing the stories behind them. Whether you're here to find inspiration for your next knitting project or to learn a bit more about the balance between nursing and needlecraft, I hope you find something that piques your interest. Feel free to browse my gallery, check out my latest patterns, or drop me a line if you have any questions or just want to chat about knitting and life in the healthcare world.
