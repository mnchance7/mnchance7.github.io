        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <p>Cragislist is one of the oldest sites that hasn't changed in all its years of existence.
                It's a popular selling app where you can sell anything wheather that be a skill or be a physical item.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast- For this website you have very little contrast. You have a white background with grey backround for the sub headings and blue font for 
                    everything else. While easy to traverse its very hard to look at being that every piece of text is a link.
                </li>
                <li>Repititon- This website meets it in that they used a very limited color scheme and almost repeat to often being that every font is the same 
                    and every piece of text is the same color.
                </li>
                <li>Alingment- It uses the gird style alignment. Everything is aligned in long rows that don't neccesarily look the best</li>
                <li>Proximity- This is one that is dont semi correct as they do have all subcategories that they belong to but they have very large 
                 broad groups. Like a jobs group that has extremely broad and has a lot of different options inside of it. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.walmart.com/?&gclsrc=aw.ds&adid=22222222220220085369&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=e&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=521205638070&wl4=aud-2230653093054:kwd-27665750&wl5=9009991&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&veh=sem&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAq4KuBhA6EiwArMAw1EUYmw0BOyUoNCDJSosas_z7OLPtEt0_eYi4dDfDiURW1QNhOUm0gBoCdRcQAvD_BwE">Walmart</a></h3>
            <p>Walmart is a large supplier of everything. Walmart is known for selling a plethora of items. All of which are normally
                fairly priced. They are one of the largest retail stores in the country.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast- The contrast on this site versus craiglist is much better. The first is seen in the nav bar where you can clearly see the 
                    a difference in color. The links as well there're not colored they underline when hovered on so it makes the site look much cleaner.
                </li>
                <li>Reptition- This website has good repition in that there are not any random points of obsecure fonts everything is uniform throughout 
                    all the different pages. 
                </li>
                <li>Alignment- Again for most the pages they are using a grid system the difference is that they're grid is much easier to see
                    though cragislist is grid system the grid is very tight and constrained with a lot of similar looking information. The Walmart grid is a little
                    wider and easier to read. 
                </li>
                <li>Proximity- They do well with proximity as everything on the pages is connected with a supporting image that helps you to understand
                    what you are looking at. Craiglist didn't have this just a lot of jumbled text when maybe an image or some other signifer could be present to help
                    brekdown the immense amount of text. 
                </li>
